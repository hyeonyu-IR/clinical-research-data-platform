# Streamlit Registry Template Manual

## Scope
This template provides:
1. Form-based data entry into CSV
2. Basic validation
3. Table review and CSV export
4. Lightweight descriptive dashboard

## Intended Use
Use this as a starter scaffold and adapt variables/logic to each study protocol.

## Data Safety
1. Do not store direct identifiers in tracked files.
2. Keep operational datasets local and git-ignored.
3. Retain only de-identified templates/examples in repository.
